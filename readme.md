Jeopardy Project

Overview

For WDI17 Unit 1 project I decided to create the game, 'Jeopardy'. The theme that I implemented was Pokemon. I used the Bootstrap to utilize their modal function so that a modal with the question and answer would appear. If a correct choice is clicked the player's total score at the bottom of the screen increases. If they click the incorrect answer, the total score decreases by the amount of the value of the question they chose. The win condition is a ranking system. Based on your total score - the ranking changes and the goal is to obtain Pokemon Master rank.

I made the mistake of heavily using html instead of javascript in order which made my html very lengthy and it got very tedious to create questions and go and make changes or edits. It look many hours to just trying to conceptualize how the function should operate and I had to get a lot of help from the instructor and IA to get me started. Overall, I feel that I still don't have a strong grasp on javascript and jQuery and the logic behind it. I feel that I have a very basic idea, but when I start to attempt a problem I go in circles and confuse myself.

Technologies used
- Bootstrap
- jQuery

Version 2
For version 2, I would try making it without Bootstrap and creating my own CSS. I would also try us jQuery to set up my questions and answers that get injected into the html off of a button click event to reduce the lines of code in my html.
