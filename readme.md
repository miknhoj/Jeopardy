For WDI17 Unit 1 project I decided to create the game, 'Jeopardy'. The theme that I implemented was Pokemon. I used the Bootstrap to utilize their modal function so that a modal with the question and answer would appear. If a correct choice is clicked the player's total score at the bottom of the screen increases. If they click the incorrect answer, the total score decreases by the amount of the value of the question they chose. The win condition is a ranking system. Based on your total score - the ranking changes and the goal is to obtain Pokemon Master rank.
